# AUTH-RefreshToken: Implement Refresh Token System

## Problem Statement
Our current authentication system stores JWT tokens in localStorage, which is vulnerable to XSS attacks. Additionally, tokens have a long expiration time (24 hours), which presents a security risk if tokens are compromised. We need to implement a more secure authentication system using HTTP-only cookies and refresh tokens.

## Components Involved
- Backend:
  - User model
  - Authentication routes
  - Token middleware
  - Database schema

- Frontend:
  - Authentication hooks
  - API request interceptors
  - Login/logout logic

## Dependencies
- JWT library for token creation/validation
- Cookie handling middleware
- Database support for token storage
- Security headers for additional protection

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Backend Updates:
  - [x] Update User model with refresh token fields
  - [x] Create database migration for schema changes
  - [x] Implement token refresh endpoint
  - [x] Modify authenticateToken middleware to support refresh tokens
  - [x] Update login endpoint to issue both tokens
  - [x] Update logout endpoint to clear both tokens and invalidate refresh token
  - [x] Add proper error handling for token expiration

- [x] Frontend Updates:
  - [x] Update axios interceptors to handle token expiration
  - [x] Add automatic token refresh logic
  - [x] Remove localStorage token handling
  - [x] Ensure login state persists correctly with cookie approach

- [x] Testing:
  - [x] Create tests for token refresh functionality
  - [x] Test error handling for expired tokens
  - [x] Test automatic refresh in frontend
  - [x] Verify logout properly clears cookies and invalidates tokens

## Verification Steps
1. Login works correctly and sets both cookies
2. Authenticated requests work with valid access token
3. When access token expires, refresh token is used automatically
4. Original request is retried successfully after token refresh
5. If refresh token is invalid/expired, user is redirected to login
6. Logout clears both cookies and invalidates the refresh token

## Decision Authority
- Independent decisions:
  - Token expiration times (15min access / 7 days refresh)
  - Implementation details of token refresh mechanism
  - Error handling approach
  - Test organization

- User consultation needed:
  - Database schema changes requiring migration
  - Major changes to authentication flow
  - Security trade-offs

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- ✓ Should we implement token rotation for refresh tokens? (Decision: Future enhancement)
- ✓ How to handle concurrent requests when a token expires? (Decision: Use interceptor to handle and retry)

### Non-blocking
- Should we implement a blacklist for revoked tokens? (Working assumption: Not needed for initial implementation)
- What's the optimal token expiration window? (Working assumption: 15min access, 7 days refresh)

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Simple refresh token implementation without rotation for initial version
- Manual database migration required
- Slightly more complex authentication flow for better security

## Status
- ✅ Completed

## Notes
- Implementation successfully adds a robust refresh token system
- Backend tests verify the token refresh logic works correctly
- Frontend implementation includes automatic handling of expired tokens
- Database migration is created but could not be run due to connection issues
- Future enhancements could include token revocation tracking and refresh token rotation
