# FEAT-OptimisticUpdates Test Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the optimistic updates feature implementation. It identifies all test files that need to be modified and details the new tests required to ensure the feature works correctly.

## Existing Test Files Requiring Updates

### Hook Tests
1. `/frontend/src/hooks/useAbilities.test.js`
   - Add tests for optimistic state updates
   - Test error handling and rollback functionality
   - Verify proper state management during pending operations
   - Test concurrent operations

2. `/frontend/src/hooks/useVirtuesAndFlaws.test.js`
   - Update to include optimistic update patterns
   - Test integration with character context

### Component Tests
1. `/frontend/src/components/CharacterSheetComponents/AbilityInput.test.js`
   - Add tests for pending operation state rendering
   - Test disabled states during operations
   - Test visual feedback during optimistic updates

2. `/frontend/src/components/CharacterSheetComponents/AbilityList.test.js`
   - Test rendering of multiple abilities with different pending states
   - Test integration with the useAbilities hook

3. `/frontend/src/components/CharacterSheetComponents/CharacteristicsAndAbilitiesTab.test.js`
   - Test experience point display with pending operations
   - Test integration with the character context
   - Verify proper updates when operations complete

4. `/frontend/src/components/CharacterSheetComponents/CharacterSheet.test.js`
   - Update to account for the new CharacterProvider
   - Test provider integration

## New Test Files Required

1. `/frontend/src/hooks/useOptimisticUpdate.test.js`
   - Test the core optimistic update functionality
   - Test error handling and rollback
   - Test concurrent operation handling
   - Test different update scenarios

2. `/frontend/src/contexts/CharacterProvider.test.js`
   - Test the provider's state management
   - Test optimistic update pattern
   - Test synchronization with server data
   - Test error handling and recovery

3. `/frontend/src/__test-utils__/optimisticUpdateUtils.js`
   - Create test utilities for simulating optimistic updates
   - Add mock functions for testing pending operations
   - Create helpers for verifying state transitions

## Test Fixture Updates

1. `/frontend/src/__test-utils__/fixtures/characters.js`
   - Add sample characters with experience points
   - Include different character types for testing XP pool logic
   - Add fixtures with pending operations

2. `/frontend/src/__test-utils__/fixtures/abilities.js`
   - Update ability fixtures to include XP values
   - Add fixtures for abilities in different states (pending, error, etc.)

## Test Mocks Required

1. `/frontend/src/__test-utils__/mocks/api.js`
   - Add mock implementations for delayed responses
   - Create error simulation for testing rollbacks
   - Add network latency simulation

2. `/frontend/src/__test-utils__/mocks/CharacterContext.js`
   - Create mock implementation of the Character context
   - Add test utilities for manipulating context state

## Testing Approaches

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions in isolation
- Verify calculations (XP, scores, etc.) are correct
- Test edge cases (min/max values, error conditions)
- Test state transitions

### Component Tests
- Test rendering with different combinations of props
- Verify visual feedback during operations
- Test user interactions trigger correct state changes
- Verify components respond appropriately to context changes

### Integration Tests
- Test communication between components
- Verify data flow from user action to optimistic update to API call
- Test proper state updates when operations complete
- Test error recovery flows

### Snapshot Tests
- Create snapshots for different UI states during optimistic updates
- Capture pending, success, and error states

## Common Test Scenarios

### XP Calculation and Display
1. Test that XP is immediately deducted when ability is incremented
2. Test that XP is immediately refunded when ability is decremented
3. Test that pending XP changes are visually indicated
4. Verify XP state is consistent after multiple operations

### Error Handling
1. Test UI recovery when server returns an error
2. Test proper error messages are displayed
3. Verify proper state rollback when operations fail
4. Test retry functionality

### Concurrent Operations
1. Test multiple ability updates happening simultaneously
2. Verify proper handling of operation order
3. Test conflict resolution when operations affect the same resources
4. Verify UI accurately reflects multiple pending operations

## Test Implementation Guidelines

1. Use React Testing Library for component tests
2. Use Jest for hook and unit tests
3. Follow the existing patterns in the test files
4. Use the setup function pattern from `/frontend/src/__test-utils__`
5. Isolate tests using proper mocking
6. Add data-testid attributes for selecting elements in tests
7. Use act() for all state updates in tests
8. Add meaningful assertions that verify behavior, not implementation
9. Test both happy paths and error scenarios
10. Test edge cases like initial render, empty states, and loading states

## Implementation Phases

1. Phase 1: Set up test utilities and mocks
2. Phase 2: Update existing tests to not break with new implementation
3. Phase 3: Add tests for new components and hooks
4. Phase 4: Add integration tests for the complete optimistic update flow

By following this test strategy, we'll ensure the optimistic updates feature is robust, reliable, and maintainable over time.
