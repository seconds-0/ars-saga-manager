# RegisterForm.test.js Refactoring Plan

## Task ID: TEST-RegisterForm

## Problem Statement
The RegisterForm.test.js file has several issues and doesn't fully align with our established testing best practices. It needs refactoring to improve consistency, readability, and test coverage, while following our new testing standards.

## Components Involved
- RegisterForm component
- RegisterForm.test.js
- useAuth hook
- Toast component
- API interactions with authentication endpoints

## Dependencies
- React Testing Library
- Jest
- Mock implementations for authentication and notifications
- Understanding of form validation and submission logic

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Analyze current test structure and identify issues
- [ ] Create consistent setup function with standardized mocks
  - [ ] Standardize Toast component mocking
  - [ ] Create consistent API mocking patterns
  - [ ] Set up fake timers properly
- [ ] Refactor test structure
  - [ ] Organize tests into clear describe blocks
  - [ ] Consolidate duplicate test cases
  - [ ] Break down overly long tests into focused cases
- [ ] Enhance test coverage
  - [ ] Add test for email format validation
  - [ ] Add test for password length/complexity requirements
  - [ ] Add test for loading state during submission
  - [ ] Add test for form reset after submission
- [ ] Improve test selectors
  - [ ] Replace data-testid selectors with more user-centric queries where possible
  - [ ] Use consistent selector patterns throughout tests
- [ ] Clean up and standardize
  - [ ] Extract test data to constants
  - [ ] Add consistent mock cleanup in beforeEach/afterEach
  - [ ] Improve test descriptions for clarity
- [ ] Run tests and verify functionality
  - [ ] Run the refactored tests using batched test runner
  - [ ] Fix any failing assertions
  - [ ] Verify full test coverage

## Verification Steps
- [ ] All tests pass with `npm run test:batched -- --pattern=RegisterForm`
- [ ] Tests cover all key functionality:
  - [ ] Rendering with correct initial state
  - [ ] Form validation (all error cases)
  - [ ] Form submission (success and failure)
  - [ ] UI interactions (typing, clicking, etc.)
  - [ ] Proper timing with toast messages
- [ ] Tests follow the established best practices:
  - [ ] Clear setup function that returns useful test objects
  - [ ] Logical describe blocks
  - [ ] Focused test cases
  - [ ] Proper mock cleanup
  - [ ] User-centric test selectors where possible

## Decision Authority
I can make decisions on:
- Test organization and structure
- Mock implementation details
- Test selectors and assertions
- Adding additional test cases for better coverage

User input needed for:
- Clarification on specific business rules for validation if needed
- Approval of significant changes to test approach

## Questions/Uncertainties

### Blocking
- None identified yet

### Non-blocking
- What specific validation rules should be tested for email and password fields?
  - Assumption: Standard email format (contains @ and domain) and minimum 8 character password
- Is there a preference for how loading states should be tested?
  - Assumption: Test for disabled button state and/or loading indicator during submission

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Some limited use of test IDs is acceptable when user-centric queries aren't practical
- Tests should focus on behavior over implementation, even if it means fewer assertions
- Form validation tests can focus on key validation rules rather than exhaustive testing of all edge cases

## Status
Blocked

## Notes
The current test file has a good foundation but needs refinement to align with our new standards. The refactoring should preserve the existing test coverage while improving structure, readability, and maintainability.

### Implementation Attempts and Challenges
- Created a refactored version of the test with improved organization, better helper functions, and more consistent patterns
- Simplified tests to focus on core functionality while following best practices
- Encountered persistent timeout issues during test execution, even with minimal test code
- Tests fail consistently with the batched test runner due to exceeding execution time limits

### Possible Solutions
1. Investigate potential configuration issues in Jest setup
2. Check for problematic dependencies in the RegisterForm component
3. Try running tests with increased timeouts specifically for this component
4. Consider if there's an issue with the mock implementations causing performance problems
5. Review the batched test runner implementation for potential improvements with WSL timeout handling
