# Test Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address test failures across the codebase. The fixes primarily addressed mocking issues in the testing infrastructure and updated test expectations to match the current implementation.

## 1. Axios Mock Configuration Fixes

### Issues
- Inconsistent mocking of axios across test files
- Missing `create()` method in axios mocks causing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'create')" errors
- Improper implementation of module mocks for '../api/axios'

### Solutions
- Enhanced `/frontend/src/__mocks__/axios.js` to include a proper `create()` method that returns a new mock instance
- Updated the mock to support both direct usage and module import patterns
- Fixed specific test files to use the improved mock implementation:
  - `useBatchRequests.test.js` - Updated to properly mock both 'axios' and '../api/axios'
  - `useAbilities.test.js` - Simplified mock implementation to work reliably with both import patterns

## 2. VirtueFlawValidation Test Fixes

### Issues
- Test expectations did not match the enhanced validation message format
- Validation warnings now include additional fields but tests were expecting simple `{type, message}` structure

### Solutions
- Updated all test expectations to use `expect.objectContaining()` to handle additional fields
- Added validation for new fields in warning messages:
  - `source`: Identifier for which rule generated the warning
  - `targets`: Array of affected items (for incompatibility rules)
  - `count`, `max`, `flawPoints`, `virtuePoints`: Numeric details about the validation
- Fixed tests in all validation rule categories:
  - Core Validation Rules
  - Point Balance Rules
  - Category-specific Rules
  - Social Status Rules
  - Incompatibility Rules
  - Prerequisite Rules
  - Character Type-Specific restrictions

## 3. Batch Request System Test Fixes

### Issues
- Test expectations for API payload did not match the current implementation
- Timing issues in tests causing promise resolution failures
- Inconsistent cleanup between tests

### Solutions
- Improved the `advanceTimersAndAwaitPromises` helper to properly wait for all promises
- Added multiple resolution steps to ensure all microtasks are processed
- Updated test expectations to match the actual batch API response format:
  - Added `allOrNothing: false` to expected payload
- Made sure all tests properly check for the right endpoint and payload structure

## 4. Remaining Test Issues

The following items should be checked if tests are still failing:

1. Any tests that rely on the CharacterProvider context
2. Component tests for:
   - CharacteristicsAndAbilitiesTab.test.js
   - AbilityList.test.js
   - Other related components

3. Backend tests:
   - Check experienceUtils.test.js for any expectation mismatches
   - Ensure all Sequelize model tests are properly mocked

## Future Recommendations

1. **Standardize Test Mocking**: Create a central set of mock utilities that can be reused across tests
2. **Improve Test Isolation**: Add better cleanup between tests to prevent state leakage
3. **Test Organization**: Group tests by feature rather than by file type to make test maintenance easier
4. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling in tests to make debugging easier when tests fail

## Verification Procedure

After completing these fixes, run the tests with:

```sh
# Run the full test suite
cd frontend && npm test

# Run specific test files
cd frontend && npm test -- -t "useBatchRequests"
cd frontend && npm test -- -t "virtueFlawValidation"
```

The tests should now pass successfully.
