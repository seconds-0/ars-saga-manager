# Batch Implementation Test Scripts

This directory contains scripts to test the batch request implementation. These scripts allow you to run tests and capture the output to files for later review.

## Available Scripts

### Run All Tests

This script runs all tests and saves the results to a file:

```bash
node testing/runTestsAndReport.js
```

Results will be saved to `test-results.txt`.

You can also run tests matching a specific pattern:

```bash
node testing/runTestsAndReport.js "useBatch|AbilitiesSection"
```

### Run Batch-Specific Tests

This script runs only the tests specific to the batch request implementation:

```bash
node testing/runBatchTests.js
```

Results will be saved to `batch-test-results.txt`.

### Run Integration Tests

This script runs integration tests for components that interact with the batch implementation:

```bash
node testing/runIntegrationTests.js
```

Results will be saved to `integration-test-results.txt`.

## Understanding Test Results

The test results files contain:

- Test command used to run the tests
- Start and end times
- Duration of the test run
- Complete test output
- Summary of test results

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with tests timing out, you can modify the timeout values in the scripts:

- In `runTestsAndReport.js`: modify the `TIMEOUT` constant
- In `runBatchTests.js`: modify the timeout in the `execSync` options
- In `runIntegrationTests.js`: modify the timeout in the `execSync` options

## Interpreting Results

When reviewing test results, focus on:

1. Test Suite Status: Look for `Test Suites: X passed, Y failed, Z total`
2. Individual Test Status: Look for `Tests: X passed, Y failed, Z total`
3. Error Messages: These provide details on why tests failed
4. Warnings: These might indicate issues that don't cause test failures but should be addressed
