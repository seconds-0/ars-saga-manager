        description: "You have been blessed or cursed as to your fate. Someone (a magician, a faerie, or other supernatural creature) has put a condition on your death, and until the condition is met, you will not die, though you can be seriously injured. You heal normally, but cannot die as a result of wounds or old age. Unfortunately for you, fate or bad planning can bring about the conditions in unexpected ways. If, for instance, your death condition is to fear only boars, you should be wary of men bearing boars on their coats of arms or of inns named after boars, in addition to the purely mundane creature. This symbolism may not be obvious: a man known as a \"pig\" in his village might also count as a boar. The storyguide must keep the prophecy in mind and give fair warning of items related to the prophecy. This is a Major Virtue because the character knows he can get away with insane risks; sneaking his prophecy up on him is an unfair way of negating the value of the Virtue. Players may only take this Virtue with the agreement of the storyguide or troupe.",

When you expend fatigue on casting a spontaneous spell, the lowest applicable Art is doubled before the whole total is divided by two. You still roll a stress die, and may botch.
