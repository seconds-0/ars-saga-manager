You are at least (25 – Int) years old, and must have scores of at least 5 in Latin and Artes Liberales. You have, however, spent eight years in a university, and gain an additional 30 experience points in each of those years, for a total of 240 additional experience points over and above your allowance based on age. You may buy Academic Abilities during character generation, and must spend your additional experience points on Academic Abilities or Teaching. You must spend two seasons teaching to maintain yourself and your reputation as a dependable instructor. These two seasons are spread between September and June, so you are genuinely free in the summer. If you take the Poor flaw, you are still genuinely free in the summer. If you take the Wealthy virtue, you can maintain your reputation with a single season's teaching.

This area should be smaller than a single Art, but may be spread over several Arts — necromancy, for example, covers both Corpus and Mentem effects. You cannot be focused on laboratory activities, although a focus does apply to laboratory activities. When you cast a spell or generate a Lab Total within your focus, add the lowest applicable Art score twice. If a spell has requisites, the lowest applicable score may be one of the requisites, rather than one of the primary Arts. Thus, if a magus with a focus on birds was casting a spell to turn a bird into pure flame, MuAn (Ig), with Muto 14, An 18, and Ig 10, his final total would be 34 + other modifiers: 14 from Muto, and 20 from adding Ignem twice. If he was casting a spell to turn a bird into another sort of bird, MuAn with no requisites, his total would be 46 + other modifiers, 18 from Animal and 28 from adding Muto twice. A character can have only one Magical Focus, either major or minor, regardless of the source of the focus.",

You have sworn vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, which together constitute a Major Story Flaw (Monastic Vows, see page 56) which you must take if you take this Virtue (this Flaw balances other Virtues as normal). You may not take the Wealthy Virtue or Poor Flaw. This Virtue is only available to male characters, and is compatible with the Magister in Artibus Major Virtue.",

When casting a spell using Wizard's Communion, you may add your Mastery score (page 86) in the spell being cast and your Mastery score in Wizard's Communion to the effective level of the Wizard's Communion. Finally, any Ritual spells which you cast have only half the usual vis requirement. If cast as part of a Wizard's Communion, all the participants need to have this Virtue to gain this benefit. Your concentration in Ritual magic has a downside, however — you may only cast Spontaneous magic using the rules for Ceremonial Casting (page 83).",
