More often, he will be in trouble and need rescuing. If any enchantment keeps you from your true love's side, the power of your devotion can probably break it. Your love is higher than mortal magic, and no magic can make you hate your love, or make you truly betray him. Your True Love must be a non-player character.

If the True Love is significantly weaker than the player character, and not able to provide useful assistance in most cases, this is a Major Flaw. If the True Love is competent, equal to or better than the player character, then this is only a Minor Flaw.",
