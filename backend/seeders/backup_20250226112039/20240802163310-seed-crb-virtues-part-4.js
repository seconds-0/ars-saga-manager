The ghost is invisible and silent to all but you and those with Second Sight (see page 67). It can see and hear what is going on around you and makes an excellent spy, since it can leave your presence once per day for up to half an hour. However, death does not leave people in their normal state of mind, so the ghost probably has some quirks that make it less than dependable — it might even encourage you to join it on the other side. The ghost has 300 experience points in various Abilities that it can use to advise you, and ghosts may take any Abilities. See page 194 for an example of a ghostly warder.",

If you act against the angel's advice, he may leave you until you correct your ways. The angel has only a limited awareness of your thoughts, but when you speak aloud, he can hear and converse with you. Your guardian angel can also help in two practical ways. First, he can grant you a +5 bonus to Soak. Second, he can grant you a Magic Resistance of 15. This magic resistance is not compatible with a magus's Parma Magica, or magic resistance from most other sources, but it does add to the magic resistance resulting from Faith Points (see page 189). The angel only grants you these bonuses if you are acting in accordance with God's will.",

If you are distracted and fail a Concentration roll, another attempt may be made in a later round. Spells and magic items can be canceled out over any distance, but once they have been canceled, you must recast a spell or reinvest a power in a magic item to start the effect again. The drawback is that when you die, all of your spells and magic items sputter out.",
